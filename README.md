<h2>What I Found Interesting</h2>
I always had an interest in games and how they were made ever since I was a young kid. Seeing articles like this one about the how far technology is able to track how our bodies move and respond by generating graphics in a VR space is just an exciting concept. I've seen people work with Unity in an attempt to create games with the typical controls accessible through a laptop or other handheld systems, but development is always a lot more trouble than can typically be seen on the surface. 

The article breaks down simple tricks that the programmer, James Kane, uses in this game. What ultimately surprised me is that I knew all of these tricks as well from what I've come across during my times in class or my own research, I've just never been able to implement anything with VR controls yet. The article goes much deeper into the concepts of neural networks and how they interact with the Unity controls, so there is a lot here to dig into for any type of developer as well.

I am also amazed by how fast technology has improved over time. I have used the leap motion before in a previous project of mine, but it was amazing how it worked. It was one of my first time making such a project so I received a lot of help, but the small object was so dense in functions it was mind blowing. Also, it was such a fun and interactive functionality that it made working with it a lot more fun!
